hxCodec is a library for [Haxe](https://haxe.org/) which provides utilities for audio and video, including:

- Audio and video playback with every imaginable codec, for frameworks such as OpenFL and HaxeFlixel.
- Support for Windows, Mac, Linux, HTML5, and mobile.
- Efficient playback with features like streaming and hardware decoding.

hxCodec is powered by [libVLC](https://www.videolan.org/vlc/libvlc.html).

## Installation

Install `hxCodec` via Haxelib:

```
haxelib install hxcodec
```

## Basic Usage

### Friday Night Funkin'

If you're an FNF modder, here's a little section of the docs just for you! Skip this if you're making your own game.

To play a cutscene between levels, add this to your PlayState:

```
import hxcodec.flixel.FlxCutsceneState;

...

/**
 * Call this in your PlayState to switch to the cutscene, then switch to the next song.
 * Put the cutscene file into the `assets/shared/videos/` folder.
 */
FlxCutscene.playCutscene(Paths.file('videos/myCutscene.mp4'), new PlayState());
```

### HaxeFlixel

If you're using HaxeFlixel, the easiest way to play a cutscene is to use the provided `FlxCutsceneState`:

```
import hxcodec.flixel.FlxCutsceneState;

...

// This will open the video file at the provided file path, play it, then transition to the next FlxState
// when the video is complete or the user presses SPACE to skip (configurable).
FlxCutscene.playCutscene(videoPath, targetState);
```

If you want more control over video playback, you can do any of these:
- Extend `FlxVideoState` and add a function which calls `playVideo()`
- Extend `FlxVideoSubState` and add a function which calls `playVideo()`
- Add an `FlxVideoSprite` as an object to your state or substate and call `playVideo()`

### OpenFL

If you're using OpenFL, use `hxcodec.openfl.VideoSprite`:

```
var video:Sprite = new VideoSprite();
addChild(video);

...

video.playVideo(videoPath);
```
